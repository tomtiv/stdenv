# sudo apt install fdupes

## Once installed, you can search duplicate files using the below command:
# fdupes /path/to/folder

## For recursively searching within a folder, use -r option
#fdupes -r /home

## This will only list the duplicate files and do not delete them by itself. You can manually delete the duplicate files or use -d option to delete them.
# fdupes -d /path/to/folder
## This wonâ€™t delete anything on its own but will display all the duplicate files and gives you an option to either delete files one by one or select a range to delete it. If you want to delete all files without asking and preserving the first one, you can use the noprompt -N option
